# Projects

The GNU/Linux Users Group (GLUG) at [ACM@UIUC](https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/) is always looking for new ways to challenge it's members with projects and presentations.

Our current projects are focused on mimicking an actual enterprise environment using a [Xen Hypervisor](http://www.xenproject.org/).

If you are interested in learning more about what we are up to, or want to see a list of our current virtual machines [check out our Git repos](https://github.com/ACMLug/).
