# Meetings

One of the most frequent questions we get asked is "What can I expect if I come to a meeting?"

We currently organize meetings into the following 5-15 minute sections but have the most fun when attendees take the floor and drive the agenda. We also like alliteration.

+ Ask/Discuss/Group
  - Announcements and logistical discussions
+ Linux in the News
  - Review and discuss some Linux-related headlines
+ Education Epoch
  - Share educational resources to improve our understading e.g. new books, MOOCs, tutorials, etc.
+ Proc Period
  - Learn about Procfs by example e.g. tune your kernel, gather data, etc.
+ SSH Section
  - OpenSSH tips and tricks
+ Shell Space
  - Improve your mastery of the shell each week
+ Vim Vicinity
  - Show off your vimrc and share productivity increasing shortcuts
+ Container City
  - Sharing Linux-based container tips
+ C Corner
  - A C programming mini-series
+ Small Talks
  - Open mic, 20 min or less talks about anything FOSS related
+ Big Talks
